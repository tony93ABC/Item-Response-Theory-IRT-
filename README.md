This repository contains code based on the book 'Using R for Item Response Theory Model Applications' (Paek & Cole, 2019). I have refactored and extended the original code to improve performance and add new functionalities.
For further information regarding the differences between CML and MML estimators, please refer to the study "Point Estimation Methods with application to item response theory models" (Bartolucci & Scrucca, 2010).
